There are two types of relative clauses:

## Relative clauses
### Defining relative clauses
**Defining relative clauses** are used to **give important information** about a **person|thing|place|time|reason** in the other half of the sentence, avoiding repetitions.

**EXAMPLES:**
>  *"I like students who are happy"*
>  *"I have a dog that bark at night as well"*

### NON - Defining relative clauses
**Non defining relative clauses** are used to give **non-essential information** about a **person|thing|place|time** in the other half of the sentence; usually they are surrounded by commas ( ***,*** ).  ***That*** cannot be used.

**EXAMPLES** 
> *"William Gilbert, who was born in 1544, invented electricity"*
> *"People spend all their money on cellphones, which i find ridiculous"*

## Relative pronouns
**Relative pronouns** are used to reference the subject without repeating.

- **Which / That** -> Things or whole sentences
- **(Whom : formal) / Who / That** -> People
- **Whose** -> Possessions
- **Where** -> Places
- **When** -> Times
- **Why** -> Reasons
