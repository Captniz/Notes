## Future 

- We use the present continuous with future plans that we know when and where they would happen. 

- We use the present simple with timetables and schedules.

- We use "will" or "going to" for making predictions. 

- We use modals verbs such as "may", "might", or "could" to express future event that we are not sure when exactly would happen. 

## Extra 

- We use "will" for promises and making decisions. 

- The words "would like" are used to express wishes for the future. 

- We can use for plans "going to" and the present continuos. 

- The difference between "will" and "going to" is: 

- going to is normally used when the prediction is very certain. 

- will is used where the prediction is a bit less certain.
