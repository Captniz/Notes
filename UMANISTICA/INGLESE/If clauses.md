We have 4 types of if clauses. 

- The first one is the zero type, we use this for facts which are generally true or scientific facts. 

The form of this is with two present simple, one for condition and one for result. 

> EX: <mark style="background: #F85552AA;">"If you stand in the rain you get wet". </mark>

- The second is first type, we use this for a possible situation in the future and predicting a likely result in the future. 

The form of this is with present simple for condition and will or won't + verb for the result. 

> EX: <mark style="background: #F85552AA;">"If you study, you will pass the exam". </mark>

- The third is second type, we use this for an hypothetical or unlikely situation and in an unreal or improbable situation now or in the future. 

The form of this is past simple for the condition and "would" + verb for the result. 

> <mark style="background: #F85552AA;">EX: "If I won the lottery, I would travel a lot".</mark> 

- The fourth is third type, we use this for imaginary situation that did not happen. 

The form of this is past perfect for the condition and "would have" + past participle for the result. 

> <mark style="background: #F85552AA;">EX: "If you had studied, you would have passed the exam"</mark>

- Mixed conditional

Es in italiano, *"Se non fossi andato a letto così tardi oggi non sarei cosi stanco"*
-> *"If i had gone to bed earlier yesterday i wouldn't be so tired now"*
